# Navigation-of-an-autonomous-wheeled-robot-with-a-robotic-arm-through-doors

This thesis focuses on the development and implementation of an autonomous robotic
system capable of passing through open and half-open doors. This system uses the
dynamic field algorithm, which relies on repulsive and attractive forces to avoid
obstacles and guide the robot to its target.
The ability of robots to autonomously navigate indoor environments is critical to their
wider adoption in everyday applications, such as support in hospitals, assisting the
disabled, and providing services in shopping malls and offices. Safe and efficient
navigation through dynamic fields algorithm ensures that robots can adapt to changing
conditions and avoid dynamic obstacles in real time.
This paper presents the theoretical foundation of the dynamic field algorithm, the
methodology for navigating the robot through open and half-open doors as well as the
experimental evaluation of its performance. The results show that the robot can navigate
safely and efficiently, achieving reliable passage through doors.
The work reaches conclusions about the efficiency and possibilities of improving the
system, proposing future directions of research for the further development and
application of this technology. The successful completion of this work contributes to the
advancement of robotic technology and offers new solutions for autonomous indoor
navigation.
